	COPY the properties and method of the object that you want, and assign it to the

	to set a property you need to set a object inside the property and in this object
	set the property value */

	/* Note: the precedence of the prototypes goes from outer to inner, for example
	if you want to use a method, first its checks if the method was a property of the object
	if not, it checks if it was of the prototype, if not, it checks if it was of the
	prototype of the prototype, its hard to understand */
